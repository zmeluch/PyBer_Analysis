# PyBer

## Overview of Project
PyBer a rideshare company, has asked for an analysis on a two data sets. One set contains city 
data the other ride data. After merging the data sets, analysis was done and then visualize using matplotlib.
The focus of this analysis was mainly on comparing data from different city types. After completing this
analysis, PyBer asked for a new analysis.

### Purpose
The purpose of this new analysis, was to create a summary of the ride sharing data, broken down by each city
type. Followed by a multi line chart to demonstrate the difference in total weekly fares for each city type.
This analysis will help the company better understand the differences in fares between different city types,
helping to make decisions about how to each city type is served.

## Results

	- Urban city types account for the most rides, drivers and total fares.
	- Urban city types have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
	- Rural city types account for the fewest riders, drivers and total fares.
	- Rural city types have the hightest average fare per ride and fare per drivers.

	- Urban city types consistently have the highest total fares.
	- Rural city types consistently have the lowest total fares.

## Summary
To help fix the disparity in city types.
	
	- PyBer could commit more drivers to rural city types.
	- PyBer could lower the fare per ride for rural city.
	- PyBer could increase drivers for suburban city types.
